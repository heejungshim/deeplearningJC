# Deep Learning Journal Club

[Shim Lab](http://heejungshim.org), [Pique-Regi Lab](http://www.genetics.wayne.edu/faculty/roger-pique-regi), and [Luca Lab](http://www.lucalab.wayne.edu/HOME.html) are reading papers on deep learning and its application to genomics. Feel free to email us if you'd like to join (even for a particular paper) or you have any suggestions.
